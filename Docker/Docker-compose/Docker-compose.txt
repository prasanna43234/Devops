Docker Compose is a tool used for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to manage multiple services, networks, and volumes using a single configuration file, typically called docker-compose.yml. With Docker Compose, you can spin up complex applications that require several containers, like web servers, databases, and caching layers, all in one command.

Key Components of Docker Compose:

Services: Define the different containers in your application. Each service runs one image and can define options such as ports, environment variables, volumes, and networks.
  
Networks: Allow communication between containers. Docker Compose automatically creates a default network for services to communicate.

Volumes: Define shared storage between containers or between the container and the host.
